# 🚀 Clone All My Repos (Because There Are Just Too Many)

You know that feeling when someone says:

> "Hey, can you send me your GitHub projects?"

And you reply:

> "Which 47?"

Yeah. Exactly.

There are simply too many legendary repositories to clone manually.  
So I made a script that clones **all my public GitHub repositories** in one go.

Because typing `git clone` 100 times is not scalable.  
And we like scalable things.

---

## 😎 What This Does

- Fetches all public repositories of **ryu878**
- Clones them via SSH
- Drops them into your current directory
- Makes you look efficient and slightly dangerous

It uses the GitHub API + standard `git clone`.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `git`
- `requests` library

Install dependency:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Calls GitHub API:

```bash
https://api.github.com/users/ryu878/repos
```
### 2. Collects repository names (with pagination).

### 3. Runs:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ryu878/REPO_NAME.git
```

For. Every. Repo.

No manual suffering required.

## 🏎️ Usage

Just run it inside the directory where you want everything cloned:

```bash
python clone_all.py
```
Example:
```bash
mkdir ryu-world
cd ryu-world
python clone_all.py
```

Boom 💥
All repos cloned into `ryu-world/`.

## 📂 Result

Your directory will look like:

```bash
ryu-world/
 ├── project-alpha/
 ├── quant-bot/
 ├── crypto-engine/
 ├── some-experimental-thing/
 ├── ...
```
Yes, there will be many.

## 🤖 Why?

Because:

- Cloning one repo is normal.
- Cloning five repos is fine.
- Cloning fifty repos manually is a crime against productivity.
- This script restores balance.

## 🛑 Notes

- Only clones public repositories
- Will not overwrite existing folders (git will fail if repo exists)

## 🧨 Warning

After cloning everything, you may:
- Discover unfinished genius
- Find over-engineered experiments
- Enter a recursive refactor loop
- Lose track of time

You were warned.

## 🐚 Ultra-Lazy Mode (No Python. No Dependencies. No Drama.)

If you're thinking:

> "Nice script... but I refuse to install anything."

Good news.  
You don’t need Python.  
You don’t need `pip`.  
You barely need motivation.

Just use the shell version.

---

### ⚡ One-Minute Setup

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x clone_all.sh
```
Run it:
```bash
./clone_all.sh
```

## 🧠 Requirements

- git
- curl

That’s it.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Because sometimes:

- You’re on a fresh server
- You don’t want Python
- You don’t want pip

You just want ALL THE REPOS

Shell script.
One file.
Zero excuses.

Choose your weapon:

- 🐍 Python version (structured, scalable)
- 🐚 Shell version (minimalist chaos energy)

Both will clone everything.
Because typing git clone `57 times` is not a lifestyle.

## TODO:

There are too many great repos.

So naturally, the correct solution is…  
to re-implement the same cloning logic in multiple languages.

Because engineering.


## 🐍 Python (Responsible Adult Mode)

Structured. Clean. Uses GitHub API properly.  
Makes you feel productive.

## 🐚 Bash (Minimalist Chaos Mode)

No Python. No pip. No mercy.

Runs everywhere. Parses JSON with grep like it's 2009.

## 🟢 Node.js (Frontend Developer Went Rogue)

Because obviously we needed:
```bash
node clone_all.js
```
Even though it just calls `child_process.exec("git clone ...")`.

Bonus points if you add:

- async/await
- 17 npm dependencies
- a progress spinner

## 🦀 Rust (Performance Matters For Cloning 30 Repos)

- Blazing fast GitHub API calls.
- Compiled binary.
- Zero runtime overhead.
- Totally unnecessary.

## 🐹 Go (Cloud Native Clone Engine)

- Single static binary.
- Perfect for Docker.
- Could be deployed to Kubernetes.

Why?

Nobody knows.

## ☕ Java (Enterprise Edition)

- 14 classes
- 3 interfaces
- Factory pattern
- RepositoryRepository

Clones repos in a scalable, microservice-ready architecture.

## 🧠 C++ (Because We Can)

- Manually parse JSON.
- Manage memory.
- Segfault once.

Clone successfully.

## 🐘 PHP (Yes, Even PHP)

For maximum confusion.

- Deploy to shared hosting.
- Expose as a web endpoint: `/clone-everything.php`

Danger level: high.

## 💎 Ruby (Startup Founder Mode)

- Elegant.
- Readable.
- Clones repos while drinking espresso.

## 🧮 PowerShell (Corporate Windows Mode)

For those who said:

> "We don't allow bash here."

## 🧙 The Absurd Version

- Brainfuck
- Assembly
- Excel VBA
- Terraform module that provisions a VM just to clone repos

Because at this point, it's not about cloning.

It's about commitment.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Cloning one repository is normal.

Cloning all repositories at once is a personality trait.

Choose your language wisely.

Or implement them all.

But wait... **Where is Haskell**? Leaving out Haskell was... **morally incorrect**.

## 🧙 Haskell (Academic Superiority Mode)

Because cloning repositories is obviously a pure functional problem.

We will:

- Model GitHub as a Monad
- Traverse paginated API responses
- Compose side effects responsibly
- Then finally perform `IO` like civilized humans

### Why Haskell?

Because:

- Side effects must be contained.
- Cloning repos is impure.
- Purity must be defended.

### Warning

After implementing this in Haskell you may:
- Start using `mapM_` in daily conversation
- Explain monads to friends at dinner
- Refuse to write mutable code ever again

There are too many repos.

So naturally, we solved it
with category theory.
