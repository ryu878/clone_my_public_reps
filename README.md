# 🚀 Clone All My Repos (Because There Are Just Too Many)

You know that feeling when someone says:

> "Hey, can you send me your GitHub projects?"

And you reply:

> "Which 47?"

Yeah. Exactly.

There are simply too many legendary repositories to clone manually.  
So I made a script that clones **all my public GitHub repositories** in one go.

Because typing `git clone` 100 times is not scalable.  
And we like scalable things.

## 😎 What This Does

- Fetches all public repositories of **ryu878**
- Clones them via SSH
- Drops them into your current directory
- Makes you look efficient and slightly dangerous

It uses the GitHub API + standard `git clone`.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `git`
- `requests` library

Install dependency:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Calls GitHub API:

```bash
https://api.github.com/users/ryu878/repos
```
### 2. Collects repository names (with pagination).

### 3. Runs:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ryu878/REPO_NAME.git
```

For. Every. Repo.

No manual suffering required.

## 🏎️ Usage

Just run it inside the directory where you want everything cloned:

```bash
python clone_all.py
```
Example:
```bash
mkdir ryu-world
cd ryu-world
python clone_all.py
```

Boom 💥
All repos cloned into `ryu-world/`.

## 📂 Result

Your directory will look like:

```bash
ryu-world/
 ├── project-alpha/
 ├── quant-bot/
 ├── crypto-engine/
 ├── some-experimental-thing/
 ├── ...
```
Yes, there will be many.

## 🤖 Why?

Because:

- Cloning one repo is normal.
- Cloning five repos is fine.
- Cloning fifty repos manually is a crime against productivity.
- This script restores balance.

## 🛑 Notes

- Only clones public repositories
- Will not overwrite existing folders (git will fail if repo exists)

## 🧨 Warning

After cloning everything, you may:
- Discover unfinished genius
- Find over-engineered experiments
- Enter a recursive refactor loop
- Lose track of time

You were warned.

## 🐚 Ultra-Lazy Mode (No Python. No Dependencies. No Drama.)

If you're thinking:

> "Nice script… but I refuse to install anything."

Good news.  
You don’t need Python.  
You don’t need `pip`.  
You barely need motivation.

Just use the shell version.

### ⚡ One-Minute Setup

Create a file:

```bash
nano clone_all.sh

## Enjoy 🚀
